Team Fluffy Kittens will utilize the data set provided by “The COVID Tracking Project” to create a MySQL
database capable of being queried to provide analytics on a range of statistics. 

Team Fluffy Kittens will harness all of the tools at their disposal to engineer an excellent product. Before
sinking their claws into any major task, the Fluffy Kittens will collaborate on Slack, to make sure
everyone is feeling warm and fuzzy. 

A WAMP stack will be utilized to host the MySQL database and
PyCharm will be our IDE of choice. Github will provide version control so we can ensure that everything
comes out purr-fect.

Thank you!
